# Car Counter Project

## Overview

The Car Counter Project is a computer vision application that utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm, CvZone and the OpenCV library to count the number of cars passing through the main road in a video stream. The project also demonstrates object tracking and utilizes a masking technique to focus on the region of interest.

## Features

- Real-time car detection and counting.
- Object tracking for counting the number of cars.
- Visualization of tracked cars on the video stream.
- Integration of YOLO object detection model.
- Use of SORT algorithm for multi-object tracking.
- Masking technique for focusing on a specific region.

## Getting Started

2. Install the required Python libraries.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the project script.

```
python Car_Counter.py
```

4. Play with the parameters and variables to meet your project requirements.
